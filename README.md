# Smart Playlist - Base

### This is a rewrite of the original Smart-Playlist project that will hopefully be easier to work with and implement into other projects.


SP-Base is the backend portion of the Smart-Playlist project. SP-B is an independent package that can be used in any project to make playlist manipulation easier. 

## Features
- Download playlist data into a easy to manipulate format
- Create custom playlists between multiple people
- Create "Daily Rotation" playlists to avoid replaying the same song over
- Filter for explicit content in playlists
- Playlists can be truly randomized using Python's randomization algorithm


At this current stage this project is **currently under development** and requires a good amount of baking before it is production ready.
